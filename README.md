 We basically saw a problem in today’s world that we can find Application or software’s for the people related to either Physical or Mental disabilities, but there is not any App that can solve both problems at once. Hence, we came up with a solution to help these people.
The project contains a really user friendly interface, When you run the program, firstly a Login page is showed to you after confirming your details you can move to the main menu of Sadiq, which contains 6 different characteristics to help you in every way possible, the first 3 are for people with the physical disabilities like, People who are deaf, dumb or blind. Furthermore, the next three characteristics are for people having mental disorders, and it have features like, Diary, To- Do list and an Online diagnosis which can determine your mental disorder.
